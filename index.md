### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorites because, even though the code was not really big and massive, the game ended up being pretty good. In this lab, I learned how to use the else if statement to make a high/low guessing game.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorites too, because two weeks before writing this lab, my friend explained to me the rules of blackjack. Imagine how surprised I was when, two weeks later, I saw that my assignment was to calculate the correct value of a blackjack hand, no matter how many aces were dealt. In this lab, I learned how to write functions in C++.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was the most interesting one because in this lab I had to analyze parking restriction rules on signs and only then write a program. In this lab, I used both the else if statement and functions to write a program that determines whether street parking is allowed according to given signs.
